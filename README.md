A battle-tested prompt toolkit for Scrum practitioners — 11 ready-to-use AI prompt templates covering the highest-impact scenarios for **Scrum Masters** and **Product Owners**.

## Why This Toolkit?

Most AI prompts for agile teams are too generic to be useful. This toolkit addresses that by giving every prompt:

- **A specific expert persona** with 15 years of experience in that domain
- **Three named capabilities** so the AI knows exactly what expertise to draw on
- **"You Never" guardrails** — explicit anti-patterns that prevent vague advice, individual blame, and unverifiable action items
- **Structured output formats** tied to real Scrum ceremonies and artifacts

The result: prompts that behave like a specialist colleague, not a generic assistant.

---

## The GRACE Prompt Framework

All 11 prompts follow the same five-layer structure:

```
### GOAL ###      What you want to achieve and why it matters
### ROLE ###      Expert identity + 3 capabilities + "You Never" guardrails
### CONTEXT ###   Business scenario, team details, and input data
### ACTION ###    Specific tasks with explicit Do / Don't boundaries
### FORMAT ###    Output structure, tables, length, and examples
```

The **"You Never" guardrails** in the ROLE section are the key differentiator. Each prompt's guardrails are tailored to the most common failure modes of that specific scenario — not generic boilerplate.

## How to Use

### Step 1 — Describe your situation
Tell the AI what you're working on. Examples:
- *"I need to check if these user stories are ready for Sprint Planning"*
- *"Help me analyze our app store reviews for product insights"*
- *"We just finished a retro — help me find the patterns in this feedback"*

### Step 2 — The skill selects the scenario
The skill matches your description to the most relevant prompt template from the library.

### Step 3 — Fill in the placeholders
The prompt output will include `[placeholders]` for anything the skill needs from you — team size, Sprint goal, raw data, etc. Fill these in and run the completed prompt.

### Step 4 — Copy and use
Paste the filled prompt into any AI chat (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) or use it directly here.

## Prompt Design Principles

### 1. Expert Personas, Not Generic Roles
Every prompt assigns the AI a specific expert identity with named competencies:

```
You are a senior Product Owner with 15 years of experience in agile
product development and Backlog Refinement facilitation.

Your expertise:
- Acceptance Criteria Writing (Given/When/Then, INVEST criteria)
- Dependency Mapping and Technical Risk Detection
- Story Point Estimation (Fibonacci scale, team velocity calibration)
```

### 2. "You Never" Guardrails
Each scenario has three tailored anti-patterns. Examples:

| Scenario | "You Never" Rules |
|----------|------------------|
| DoR Check | Accept vague language like "user-friendly" without challenging it |
| Risk Analysis | Surface one-time incidents as systemic risks |
| Retro Analysis | Offer advice like "communicate better" / attribute problems to individuals |
| Churn Analysis | Recommend retention tactics that can't be tested within one Sprint |
| Requirements | Accept requirements written as solutions ("we need a button that...") |

### 3. Verifiable, Sprint-Scoped Actions
All action items and recommendations produced by these prompts are constrained to be:
- **Completable** within one Sprint
- **Measurable** with a defined success criterion
- **Systemic** — never attributed to individual people
