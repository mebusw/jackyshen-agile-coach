# Jacky Shen's Agile Coach Prompt Toolkit

This skill encapsulates 11 core scenario prompts designed by Jacky Shen (Chief Agile Coach, Scrum Alliance Certified CST) for Scrum agile teams, covering high-frequency work scenarios for both **Scrum Masters** and **Product Owners**.

## How to Use

1. **Identify the scenario**: Match the user's description to the most relevant scenario(s) in the table below
2. **Load the reference**: Read `references/prompt-library.md` for the full prompt template
3. **Customize**: Replace `[placeholders]` with the user's specific details (team size, product name, data, etc.)
4. **Add guidance**: Alongside the prompt, share the best-practice usage tip for that scenario

## Usage Standards

### Prompt Structure (RACT Framework)

All prompts follow this five-layer structure:

```
### GOAL ###       → Core purpose and expected outcome
### ROLE ###       → Expert identity, capabilities, and "Never Do" guardrails
### CONTEXT ###    → Business scenario, audience, relevant data
### ACTION ###     → Specific tasks with Do / Don't constraints
### FORMAT ###     → Output structure, length limits, examples
```

### Output Principles

- **Deliver ready-to-use prompts**: Output fully filled-in prompts the user can copy immediately
- **Mark unfilled placeholders**: Use `[TO FILL: description]` for any missing user info
- **Include a usage tip**: Note which Scrum ceremony or workflow context this prompt fits best
- **Language**: Default to the language the user is writing in
